        <h2>My Favorite Hobby<br><span id="hobby">Playing Shuttle</span></h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My favorite hobby is shuttle.I like it because it is like a exercise and a joyful game.A shuttle is a tool designed to neatly and compactly store a holder that carries the thread of the weft yarn while weaving with a loom. Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed, between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft.Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" and "doubles".It was first played in 19th century.the equipment use is Shuttlecock and racquet.Rules
A match consists of the best of three games of 21 points.
The player/pair winning a rally adds a point to its score.
At 20-all, the player/pair which first gains a 2-point lead wins that game.
At 29-all, the side scoring the 30th point wins that game.
The player/pair winning a game serves first in the next game.
A badminton match can be played by two opposing players (singles) or four opposing players (doubles).
A competitive match must be played indoors utilising the official court dimensions.
A point is scored when the shuttlecock lands inside the opponent's court or if a returned shuttlecock hits the net or lands outside of the court the player will lose the point.
At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite service courts.
A legal serve must be hit diagonally over the net and across the court.
A badminton serve must be hit underarm and below the server's waist height with the racquet shaft pointing downwards, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce. After a point is won, the players will move to the opposite serving stations for the next point.
The rules do not allow second serves.
During a point a player can return the shuttlecock from inside and outside of the court.
A player is not able to touch the net with any part of their body or racket.
A player must not deliberately distract their opponent.
A player is not able to hit the shuttlecock twice.
A 'let' may be called by the referee if an unforeseen or accidental issue arises.
A game must include two rest periods. These are a 90-second rest after the first game and a 5-minute rest after the second game. </p>
